# Biodiversity National Parks EDA & Hypothesis Testing

The biodiversity dataset is a fictional dataset based on species in a number of national parks.

The notebook contains some exploratory data analysis on the species and then some testing of hypotheses about the data using the scipy library.

The analysis can be found in the notebook: [biodiversity.ipynb](https://github.com/rosslogan702/data-science-biodiversity-eda/blob/master/biodiversity.ipynb)
